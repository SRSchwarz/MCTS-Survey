\begin{abstract}
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a sampling-based, iterative search algorithm that is well known to address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and was made famous in its application to the game Go. Its basic formulation works well in small or simple domains. However, applying it to specific use cases which have unique requirements (like real-time or cooperative scenarios) necessitates additional engineering. Consequently there has been a lot of research into extending MCTS to these new domains. This mainly concerns performance improvements, modifying the algorithm's components to leverage domain knowledge or through the use of heuristics. This survey presents notable examples of this research.
